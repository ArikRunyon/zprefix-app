# Welcome to Zapp Manager!

The first step in running this locally to your machine is to ensure that you have docker installed. (I imagine, I'm nowhere close to an expert, probably wouldn't even qualify as an apprentice!)

After that you'll need to fork and clone down this repo.

Once that is done use a terminal to navigate into the primary folder "zprefix-app".

When you arrive at your destination run the following command in your terminal:

"docker compose up -d"

This command will build or pull down the images you need, and install all of the required dependencies! It will also launch the app once it is completed!

To use the application open a new chrome tab and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/". (I will not, nor cannot, guarantee the operation of this app outside of chrome...or inside chrome for that matter. Only a sith deals in guarantees.)

If the page loads up, great! You can now use the app! If not, I clearly needed to do more testing. Uh oh. Uh...sorry?
